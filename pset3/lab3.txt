sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: In the sorted files it is close in time to merge sort and even better timing with 50000 numbers. 
Omega(n) for bubble sort is when the array is perfectly sorted.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Is the fastest of all 3 algorithms, however took more time on the sorted 50000.
Even if the array is perfectly sorted, the algorithm still need to split and recombine.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: In terms of timing it is in between Bubble and Merge sort as it needs to go through
all of the elements of an array.
